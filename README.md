# Tool games for physical reasoning

In this repository you will find:

* Python code to load levels, visualize levels, create levels, and simulate actions within levels ([environment/](https://github.com/k-r-allen/tool-games/tree/master/environment))
* Level jsons used in the PNAS paper (in [environment/Trials](https://github.com/k-r-allen/tool-games/tree/master/environment/Trials))
* Human and model data for these level jsons (in [data/](https://github.com/k-r-allen/tool-games/tree/master/data))

If you are interested in playing around with the code, or building machine agents for this environment, check out the instructions [here](https://github.com/k-r-allen/tool-games/tree/master/environment).

After installing needed dependencies, a good place to start to understand how to use our API is [make_basic_trial.py](https://github.com/k-r-allen/tool-games/blob/master/environment/make_basic_trial.py) which shows you how to create a level, save it, load it, simulate an action inside it, and visualize the result of that action.
